### WHAT IS AZURE DevOps?
* Microsoft Azure DevOps provides an end-to-end DevOps toolchain for developing and deploying software. It also integrates with most leading tools on the market and is advantageous for orchestrating a DevOps toolchain.

* Azure DevOps provides services for software development teams to plan work, collaborate on code implementation, and build and deploy software products. Azure DevOps supports a collaborative culture and methodologies that bring together software developers, project managers, and contributors to develop software. It permits companies to make and enhance products quicker than orthodox software development approaches.

## AZURE DevOps SERVICES VS. AZURE DevOps SERVER

* Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server offer the same DevOps features. However, there are some differences to note, which we cover in this section

* __Azure DevOps Services__: You can access the software-as-a-service offering for Azure DevOps through the Internet. This web-based service has a service-level agreement of at least 99.9 percent uptime, making it reliable. Azure DevOps services are also globally distributed.

* __Azure DevOps Server__: Azure DevOps Server's backing foundation is a customizable SQL server backend. If your organization embraces this version, you can access the on-premise offering over your internal network. This option is crucial for organizations that want all their data only on their own networks for business reasons.

### AZURE DevOps FEATURES

* __Azure Boards__: Software development teams can use the interactive and configurable tools in Azure Boards for managing their software projects. It delivers various features, including support for agile and scrum, customizable dashboards, and reporting. As your business grows, you can scale these tools.

* __Azure Repos__: Azure Repos is a collection of version control and source code management tools in the Azure DevOps toolset. Version control tools are applications that help you track changes you make in your code in real time. As you update your code, you tell the version control tool to take a snapshot of your files. The version control tool saves that snapshot, and you can retrieve it later when needed.

* __Azure Test Plans__: Azure Test Plans is a test management platform with all the abilities required for different testing styles and gathering feedback from stakeholders. Some testing styles include planned manual testing, user acceptance testing, and exploratory testing.
* __Azure Artifacts__: Azure Artifacts allows software developers to share their code effectively and handle all their packaged code from one place. With Azure Artifacts, developers can publish packages to their feeds and share them within the same team, across multiple product teams or organizations, and even publicly.
